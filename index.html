    <td>2,4-D</td>
    <td>2,4-D is a widely used herbicide that controls broadleaf weeds that has been used as a pesticide since the 1940s. It is used in many places including turf, lawns, rights-of-way, aquatic sites, forestry sites, and a variety of field, fruit and vegetable crops. It may also be used to regulate the growth of citrus plants. Products are sold in liquid (concentrated or ready-to-use), dust, or granule formulations.
2,4-D products can be safely used by following label directions. The toxicity depends on its chemical forms, including salts, esters, and an acid form. 2,4-D generally has low toxicity for humans, except certain acid and salt forms can cause eye irritation. Swimming is restricted for 24 hours after application of certain 2,4-D products applied to control aquatic weeds to avoid eye irritation. 2,4-D generally has moderate toxicity to birds and mammals, is slightly toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates, and is practically nontoxic to honeybees. The ester forms of 2,4-D can be highly toxic to fish and other aquatic life. Carefully follow label directions to avoid harmful effects.
2,4-D is not Agent Orange. Agent Orange was a mixture of two different herbicides: 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D (as well as kerosene and diesel fuel). 2,4,5-T contained high levels of dioxin, a contaminant, found to cause cancer and other health problems in people. Dioxins are no longer found at detectable levels in 2,4-D products sold and used in the United States. Furthermore, EPA has canceled all uses of 2,4,5-T in 1985 and no longer allow its use in the United States.

    <td>Aldicarb Sulfoxide</td>
    <td>Aldicarb sulfoxide is a carbamate pesticide. 
Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. 
They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. 
The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. 
Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. 
Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. 
Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment.

<tr>
    <td>Benzo(A)Pyrene</td>
    <td>Leaching from linings of water storage tanks and distribution lines. 
Benzo[a]pyrene is a five-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). 
Benzo[a]pyrene (along with other PAHs) is released into the atmosphere as a component of smoke from forest fires, industrial processes, vehicle exhaust, cigarettes, and through the burning of fuel (such as wood, coal, and petroleum products). 
Oral exposure to benzo[a]pyrene can occur by eating certain food products, such as charred meats, where benzo[a]pyrene is formed during the cooking process, or by eating foods grown in areas contaminated with benzo[a]pyrene (from the air and soil). 
Dermal exposure may occur from contact with soils or materials that contain soot, tar, or crude petroleum products or by using certain pharmaceutical products containing coal tars, such as those used to treat the skin conditions, eczema and psoriasis. 
The magnitude of human exposure to benzo[a]pyrene and other PAHs depends on factors such as lifestyle (e.g., diet, tobacco smoking), occupation, and living conditions (e.g., urban versus rural setting, domestic heating, and cooking methods).

Chloramines have been used by water utilities since the 1930s.  More than one in five Americans uses drinking water treated with chloramines.
Water that contains chloramines and meets EPA regulatory standards is safe to use for:
Drinking
Cooking
Bathing
Other household uses
Many public water systems (PWSs) use chlorine as their primary disinfectant. However, some PWSs changed their secondary disinfectant to chloramines to meet disinfection byproduct requirements. Since then, consumers have raised questions about this switch in disinfection.

In the early 1900s, radium was wrongly used to treat rheumatism and mental disorders and as a general tonic.
Radium was also used to make luminous paints for watch dials, clocks, glow in the dark buttons, and military instruments. 
The use of radium for these purposes was discontinued because of the health hazards from these types of exposures. 
Radium has also been widely used in radiation treatment of cancer, but this use has largely been replaced by other radioactive materials or methods. Radium-226 has also been used in medical equipment, gauges, and calibrators, and in lightning rods.

    <td>Consumer Confidence Rule</td>
    <td>On March 28, 2023, EPA announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would strengthen the Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) Rule making annual drinking water quality reports with important public health information more accessible to residents and businesses across the country. 
A Consumer Confidence Report, sometimes called an “Annual Drinking Water Quality Report,” summarizes information about the local drinking water for the previous year. 
EPA’s proposal would support public education by more clearly communicating important information in water quality reports and improving access to the reports.
 As part of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA), Congress instructed EPA to revise the CCR Rule. 
The proposed revisions support the goal of the SDWA “right-to-know” provisions by improving the CCRs so that people can make better decisions about their drinking water.
 EPA’s proposed CCR rule will work to further that goal by making sure important information in annual reports are accurate and accessible.

It is a concern because the oocysts are resistant to the common chlorine and chloramine water disinfectants.
Cryptosporidium oocysts are ubiquitous in source waters in the US. Principally related to livestock, C. parvum oocysts from deposited fecal matter can be picked up by run off over soil surfaces and transported to surface waters. 
The oocysts can also be transported though soil to ground water. 
They can persist in waters for extended periods of time. They can survive freezing better than survive 25 C. 
They have low specific gravity (about 1.05 g/cc) and are buoyant so that oocysts not bound to particles tend to float to the top of a water column. 
However, they are likely bound to organics and particulate surfaces and suspended in surface waters.
